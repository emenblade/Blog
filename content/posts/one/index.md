And I'm not typically any good at it! But here's some photos I've taken that I really like.
The First photo is of my car, when we went camping a few years back, theres just something about sunsets that make a photo of nearly anything look nice!
The Second one was taken in golden BC in the wee morning hours at a bachelor party! Sunrise in the mountains sure is something to behold!
And the third one is of a lilac tree in bloom! That particular tree only seems to bloom for like a weekend a year, I was super excited I caught it!
